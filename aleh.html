				<h2>Aleh Remezau</h2>
				<div class="bodyLine"></div>
				<p>Known for his “sensuous and exuberant” performances (The Millbrook Independent), Aleh Remezau joined the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra in 2020 as its Principal Oboist. Since joining the orchestra, his playing has been highlighted in works such as Ravel’s Le Tombeau de Couperin, Stravinsky’s Pulcinella Suite and Rimsky Korsakov’s Scheherazade. This season, Aleh is a featured soloist in Mozart's Quartet for Oboe and Strings as well as Henri Tomasi's Evocations for solo oboe. He appears regularly with the Esprit Orchestra, performing as both Principal Oboist and solo English horn. With Esprit, Aleh has performed at the Beijing Modern Music Festival.</p>
				<p>Mr. Remezau was an inaugural member of The Orchestra Now – a training orchestra based at Bard College, New York. With TON, Aleh was a frequent performer at Alice Tully Hall, The Metropolitan Museum, and Carnegie Hall. Additionally, Mr. Remezau has performed numerous times on oboe and English horn with the New York 
				Philharmonic, appearing on their 2017 Grammy nominated recording of Christopher Rouse’s Symphony No. 4. Mr. Remezau has also performed as a pit musician for Wicked on Broadway, in addition to performances at the Shaw Festival.</p>
				<p>Aleh is a member of The Happenstancers, an adventurous Toronto-based chamber ensemble. With a knack for combining cutting-edge contemporary repertoire with expressive works from the traditional canon, The Happenstancers feature “an obscene amount of talent” (The WholeNote), presenting concerts hailed as “bizarrely eclectic, ...very intriguing and rewarding” (John Gilks, operaramblings).</p>
				<p>Born in Minsk, Belarus, Aleh Remezau began his musical studies on piano, and began his study of the oboe at fifteen. Remezau is a graduate of the University of Toronto, where he studied with Clare Scholtz; and the Manhattan School of Music, with Liang Wang. He is an alumnus of The Music Academy of the West and Domaine Forget.</p>
