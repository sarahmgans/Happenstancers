				<h2>Brad Cherwin</h2>
				<div class="bodyLine"></div>
				<p>Hailed for his “technical prowess [and] perfect conveyance of…wit, humor, and effect” (Sarasota Herald-Tribune), clarinetist Brad Cherwin is one of “Toronto’s best young chamber musicians” (Bachtrack). His playing has been lauded as “astounding” and “a total success … as flexible in tone as possible” (Calgary Herald). Cherwin is a winner of a 2019 Dora Award for his performances as solo clarinetist in Claude Vivier’s Kopernikus with Against the Grain Theatre.</p>
				<p>Highlights of Cherwin’s 2021/2022 season include performances of Mozart and Schumann at the Stoughton Chamber Music Festival, performances with Barbara Hannigan as an Equilibrium Young Artist at the Lunenburg Academy of Music Performance, and recitals in Germany at the Tonali Saal (Hamburg) and Kuehlhaus Berlin.</p>
				<p>As a presenter and performer of new music, Cherwin has given the North American premiere performances of works by Pascal Dusapin, Wolfgang Rihm, and Kaija Saariaho, among others. This season Cherwin will give world premiere performances of music by Nahre Sol, Danika Loren, Daniel Gerzenberg, Gavin Fraser, Kristian Podlacha, and Micah Behr.</p>
				<p>Cherwin is the co-director of The Happenstancers, a Toronto-based ensemble that features "an obscene amount of talent" (The WholeNote). Their concerts have been praised as “superbly planned, with a rich banquet of textures and colours…Next time these people throw a recital, run, don’t walk” (Lydia Perovic, Definitely the Opera).</p>
				<p>Cherwin is extremely grateful for the generous support from the Toronto Arts Council, Ontario Arts Council, the Canada Council for the Arts, and the SOCAN Foundation.</p>
